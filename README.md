# Features
* Disguises and trespass system inspired by Hitman
* Enemy guard system inspired by Metal Gear Solid with different states
* Four types of guards: stationary, patrol, rotate and homing
* Interactables that can be toggled to distract guards (e.g. turning on a TV)

## Requirements
* Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer

## Getting Started
* Clone the project
* Open the project with Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer
* Open the game scene
* Press the play button

## Improvements
* Whistling cooldown indicator (a tiled circle sprite underneath the player)
* Show an icon above enemies to show if they can be distracted or not
* Show an icon above illegal interactions in the player's current disguise
* Laser beams that enable a noise sphere when the player collides with them
* Shadow areas that enemies can't see into
* Dialogue based on the player's current disguise. For example, if the player has the Band Outfit the entrance security guard still says "Band members only".
